# The Ruby Hotel

Welcome! This is a description of our project, the Ruby Hotel Management Interface, and all its beautiful nuances and synergistic functionality.

The RHMI is a web-hosted interface that is designed to be used by all Ruby Hotel staff, management, and guests. The GUI can be broken down into three basic views. The first of these is a basic guest portal, where a guest would be able to see all their past and future bookings at the various Ruby Hotel branches, and create new ones, or edit and delete future ones as they see fit. This is also the place for a guest to edit their personal contact information and payment details.

The second of these interfaces is an employee service tool. This will be used by any front desk staff to administer and manage bookings at the hotel branch they are working at. Upon logging in, the staff member will be able to oversee all the rooms at their location, as well as see basic statistics about their branch. Furthermore, they will be able to help a specific guest who has come to the front desk, identifying them by their guest ID. In doing so, the employee can then assist the guest in modifying their bookings, as well as make new ones for them at the current branch.

Finally, managers may use this tool as a powerful analytical engine for measuring the health of their branches and the Ruby Hotel franchise as a whole. From this portal, managers may hire and administrate their employees, view details about each branch's bookings and revenue, and get a summary of the hotel's costs.

The plan outlined here does not stray significantly from what was proposed at the beginning of the project. We feel we reached all the goals we had planned to with our original schema, and could feel the pay-off of well-designed tables when using the various interfaces. Althought Ruby on Rails was new to all members of this team, we learned a lot putting this interface together, both about web front-end and back-end, but mostly about database integration. We hope you enjoy perusing this project as much as we did making it!
